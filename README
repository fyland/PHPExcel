This Extension is Based On ExcelFormat, By Martin Fuchs And Yap Chun Wei. I use their code from codeproject, which can be download from http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/42504/ExcelFormat-Library .Thanks to Martin Fuchs and Yap Chun Wei.

I just wrap this library for PHP, the initial version is test on a windows 7 with Visual Studio 2008, run with PHP 5.4.9, thread safe.

The code was created a years before, just as a demo. Two years ago,I join a company works for electronic commerce, so, I always works with Excel, Initialy, We use a pure PHP version to create Excel, called PHPExcel.This library is great, but we found many times we need use it to work beyond it's design range, just like create a huge excel file. So I decide to create this extension, but with this extension, we found it generate excel very fast, but in destruct stage, it use too much time, So I droped it, use a self designed Excel Genreator instead, which is write by Java, with JXL.

Currently, I'm not busy as before, so I publish it, and try to supply more features and improve the performance by improve memory alloc.

This extension is write with Qt Creator, now the lastest version is 2.6.0, I think it may be the bestest C++ IDE, It makes coding more comfortable, thanks Nokia.

Now it with integrated charset support, so you can set utf-8 or gbk charset to Excel, and it works right!

To set default charset, you can set in you php.ini, with set entry:

	excel.default_charset	= UTF-8

Now I Test it with the code below:

	<?php
	error_reporting(E_ALL);
	$ts	= gettimeofday(true);
	$excel	= Excel::create(1, 'UTF-8');
	$font	= new ExcelFont(ExcelFont::WEIGHT_BOLD);
	$font->setColor(ExcelFont::COLOR_RED);
	$cellFmt	= new ExcelCellFormat($excel);
	$cellFmt->setFont($font);
	$sheet	= $excel->getWorkSheet(0);
	for ($row = 0; $row < 6000; ++ $row)
	{
		for ($col = 0; $col < 30; ++ $col)
		{
			$sheet->setWString($row, $col, '我是一只鱼', $cellFmt);
		}
	}
	$excel->saveAs('aaa.xls');
	echo gettimeofday(true) - $ts, ' sec';

It runs perfect on Windows Now, and it consumes almost 4.1 ~ 4.2 sec to generate this Excel, which size is about 2.55MB.
Now the integrated charset support only works on windows, and only test for chinese gbk and utf-8, Linux support will add in next week.
